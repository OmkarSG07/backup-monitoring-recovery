## ❓ Real-World Problem
In production environments:
- Data loss can happen due to human error, disk failure, or application bugs
- Manual backups are unreliable
- Lack of monitoring causes silent failures
- Logs can consume disk space if not rotated

This project solves these problems using lightweight Linux-native tools.
